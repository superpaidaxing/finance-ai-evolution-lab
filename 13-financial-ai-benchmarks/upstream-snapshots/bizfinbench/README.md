Large language models excel across general tasks, yet judging their reliability in logic‑heavy, precision‑critical domains such as finance, law and healthcare is still difficult. To address this challenge, we propose **BizFinBench**, the first benchmark grounded in real-world financial applications. **BizFinBench** comprises over 100,000+ bilingual (English & Chinese) financial questions, each rooted in real-world business scenarios. 

## 📢 News 
- 🚀 [01/05/2026] [BizFinBench.v2](https://github.com/HiThink-Research/BizFinBench.v2) has been accepted to ICML 2026.
 
- 🚀 [09/01/2026] [BizFinBench.v2](https://github.com/HiThink-Research/BizFinBench.v2) is out: 29,578 real-world financial questions so tough that ChatGPT-5 only scores 61.5/100.
  
- 🚀 [04/07/2025] External API support is now live—evaluate BizFinBench with your own endpoints in just a few calls.

- 🚀 [16/05/2025] We released <strong>BizFinBench.v1</strong> benchmark, the first benchmark grounded in real-world financial applications.


## 💡 Highlights
- 🔥  **Benchmark:** We propose **BizFinBench**, the first evaluation benchmark in the financial domain that integrates business-oriented tasks, covering 5 dimensions and 9 categories. It is designed to assess the capacity of LLMs in real-world financial scenarios.
- 🔥  **Judge model:** We design a novel evaluation method, i.e., **Iterajudge**, which enhances the capability of LLMs as a judge by refining their decision boundaries in specific financial evaluation tasks.
- 🔥  **key insights:** We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with **25 LLMs** based on BizFinBench, uncovering key insights into their strengths and limitations in financial applications.

## 📕 Data Distrubution

### Install requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Quick Start – Evaluate a Local Model

```sh
export MODEL_PATH=model/Qwen2.5-0.5B   # Path to the model to be evaluated
export REMOTE_MODEL_PORT=16668
export REMOTE_MODEL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:${REMOTE_MODEL_PORT}/model
export MODEL_NAME=Qwen2.5-0.5B
export PROMPT_TYPE=chat_template   # Hithink llama3 llama2 none qwen chat_template; chat_template is recommended

# First start the model as a service
python inference/predict_multi_gpu.py \
    --model ${MODEL_PATH} \
    --server_port ${REMOTE_MODEL_PORT} \
    --prompt ${PROMPT_TYPE} \
    --preprocess preprocess \
    --run_forever \
    --max_new_tokens 4096 \
    --tensor_parallel ${TENSOR_PARALLEL} & 

# Pass in the config file path to start evaluation
python run.py --config config/offical/eval_fin_eval_diamond.yaml --model_name ${MODEL_NAME}
```

### Quick Start – Evaluate a Local Model and Score with a Judge Model

```sh
export MODEL_PATH=model/Qwen2.5-0.5B   # Path to the model to be evaluated
export REMOTE_MODEL_PORT=16668
export REMOTE_MODEL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:${REMOTE_MODEL_PORT}/model
export MODEL_NAME=Qwen2.5-0.5B
export PROMPT_TYPE=chat_template   # llama3 llama2 none qwen chat_template; chat_template is recommended

# First start the model as a service
python inference/predict_multi_gpu.py \
    --model ${MODEL_PATH} \
    --server_port ${REMOTE_MODEL_PORT} \
    --prompt ${PROMPT_TYPE} \
    --preprocess preprocess \
    --run_forever \
    --max_new_tokens 4096 \
    --tensor_parallel ${TENSOR_PARALLEL} \
    --low_vram & 

# Start the judge model
export JUDGE_MODEL_PATH=/mnt/data/llm/models/base/Qwen2.5-7B
export JUDGE_TENSOR_PARALLEL=1
export JUDGE_MODEL_PORT=16667
python inference/predict_multi_gpu.py \
    --model ${JUDGE_MODEL_PATH} \
    --server_port ${JUDGE_MODEL_PORT} \
    --prompt chat_template \
    --preprocess preprocess \
    --run_forever \
    --manual_start \
    --max_new_tokens 4096 \
    --tensor_parallel ${JUDGE_TENSOR_PARALLEL} \
    --low_vram &

# Pass in the config file path to start evaluation
python run.py --config "config/offical/eval_fin_eval.yaml" --model_name ${MODEL_NAME}
```

> **Note**: Add the `--manual_start` argument when launching the judge model, because the judge must wait until the main model finishes inference before starting (this is handled automatically by the `maybe_start_judge_model` function in `run.py`).

### Quick Start – Evaluate external apis (e.g., chatgpt)

```sh
export API_NAME=chatgpt # The api name, currently support chatgpt
export API_KEY=xxx # Your api key
export MODEL_NAME=gpt-4.1

# Pass in the config file path to start evaluation
python run.py --config config/offical/eval_fin_eval_diamond.yaml --model_name ${MODEL_NAME}
```
> **Note**: You can adjust the API’s queries-per-second limit by modifying the semaphore_limit setting in envs/constants.py. e.g., GPTClient(api_name=api_name,api_key=api_key,model_name=model_name,base_url='https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', timeout=600, semaphore_limit=5)

## ✒️Results
The models are evaluated across multiple tasks, with results color-coded to represent the top three performers for each task:

- 🥇 indicates the top-performing model.
- 🥈 represents the second-best result.
- 🥉 denotes the third-best performance.
